Shortcut buttons is a plugin for [flatpickr](https://flatpickr.js.org/) that provides users an alternative way to interact with the datetime picker.

# Motivation
Shortcut buttons development has been motivated by the need of having a fast, flexible and seemless alternative way for users to select specific date(s) without being forced to navigate through their calendars and individually select those date(s).
